	<h2>Travis G Profile</h2>

	<p>Listing my personal profile is usually one of my least favorite things to do. I work for Rutgers University, and no Rutgers did not pay for this class (I tried). I work in the Cogen at Busch Campus, which is the power-and-heating plant. It's not a bad job it pays decent.</p>
	<p>However my industry is changing, and may change into something that may make licenses and skills obsolete. Not wanting to lost in the middle of my life, and I'm looking to learning something that move me forward.</p>
	<p>I enjoying learning and the great thing about programming is that whatever you learn you can apply right away. What ever that can be imagined can be made and applied right away.</p>
